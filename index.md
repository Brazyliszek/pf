## Welcome!

My name is Mateusz and here I want to share with you results from my projects.

The portfolio contains small and big DIY projects, some programs that I created, projects from my time at the univeristy and that sort of stuff. I tried to include some details about each of them. Projects are in chronological order from the newest to the oldest.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Brazyliszek/pf/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
